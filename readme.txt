║ Welcome to the Battleship readme!                                                        ║
║ You will be playing against the computer, and your goal is to sink all of its ships.     ║
║                                                                                          ║
║ WARNING: the game uses command line instruments to clear the console screen.             ║
║ Please launch the game in the OS' command line interface!                                ║
║                                                                                          ║
║ There are five types of ships in total, each with its own size:                          ║
║   1. Submarine - 1 cell (sector) in size                                                 ║
║   2. Destroyer - 2 cells (sectors) in size                                               ║
║   3. Cruiser - 3 cells (sectors) in size                                                 ║
║   4. Battleship - 4 cells (sectors) in size                                              ║
║   5. Carrier - 5 cell (sectors) in size                                                  ║
║                                                                                          ║
║ Before the start of the game, you'll be asked to enter a number of settings:             ║
║   1. Ocean size settings - how big the game's map is                                     ║
║   2. Ship count settings - how many ships of each type does computer have                ║
║   3. Torpedo mode settings - how many torpedoes (one-hit destruction shots) you'll have  ║
║   4. Recovery mode settings - if ships will be recovered if don't hit them with every    ║
║        shot starting from the first hit until the ship is sunk                           ║
║                                                                                          ║
║ Alternatively, you can specify the first two setting categories when launching the game  ║
║ from the command line by specifying 7 arguments after the name of the executable in      ║
║ the following format (without brackets):                                                 ║
║   [rows] [columns] [submarines] [destroyers] [cruisers] [battleships] [carriers]         ║
║ The game will then try to read these settings and, if impossible, will ask you to enter  ║
║ new settings in the game's console interface.                                            ║
║                                                                                          ║
║ The game will end when you destroy all of the computer's ships.                          ║
║ Your goal is to destroy them with as few shots as possible.                              ║
║ Good luck, and enjoy the game!                                                           ║
║                                                                                          ║
